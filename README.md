# Online Eligibility System for Government Subsidies

## Description
Government benefit programs, including but not limited to subsidy services, are an important aspect of any government in its mission to serve its people, and especially in the case of Oman which offers a variety of generous subsidy programs for its citizens.
However, issues arise when these subsidies fail to reach their intended targets; That being the people who truly need them, when systems are outdated and rely on manual efforts, human error, slow service delivery and security concerns born out of human oversight become chief concerns, which, with the endless stride of automation and digitization, and emerging technologies like AI; only become more frustrating issues.
The aim of this project is to address these weaknesses by creating a web application system which can quickly, accurately and automatically determine someone’s eligibility for subsidies by utilising machine learning techniques, while also offering integration for government officials so they can change eligibility rules.
